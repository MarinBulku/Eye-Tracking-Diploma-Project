The Eye Tracking Application is a efficient software solution created to change several areas of cognitive study and human-computer interaction. This flexible application 
incorporates the eye tracking technology in four dimensions.
First off, it provides accurate and real-time eye tracking services, giving users the capability to keep an eye on their gaze positions, blink patterns, and level of fatigue. 
This dimension provides a doorëay into understanding human attention, ëhether for the purpose of detecting ëeariness or evaluating user involvement.
The Eye Tracking Application also explores ways to improve user experience. It offers insights into design enhancements, enhancing hoë consumers interact with digital systems by storing the 
parts that are gazed the most in various interfaces.
Also this application enhances research into the effectiveness of word recognition. It explores an interesting topic of how much visual information is needed to comprehend written text. 
It provides insight into the cognitive processes underpinning language comprehension by monitoring eye movements during reading.
The Eye Tracking Application also makes driving simulations useful. In this situation, it turns into an essential tool to determine the focus and attention levels of drivers, ultimately improving traffic safety.
In summary, the Eye Tracking Application is an amazing tool that applies eye tracking technology to a wide range of industries. This program provides users with fresh perspectives into the complex 
world of mental processing and interaction, ëhether in interface design, language study, or driving safety.

Below I have a guide on how to use this application.

1. The first window that we see, from which we navigate through other applications:

2. eye-tracking.py:
  -The GazeTracking class is used to track the user's gaze, including gaze direction and eye blink detection.
  -The viewing coordinates are superimposed on the video frame, represented by a green circle, indicating the focus point on the screen.
  -Fatigue detection occurs if the user blinks several times, a warning about possible fatigue or restlessness is displayed.

3. checkThePictures.py:
  -First, the user uploads images from the computer to the application.
  -User can switch from photo to photo using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
  -A purple circle is placed on the displayed image, symbolizing the point where the user is currently looking. The circle does not move when we are not looking at the screen.

4. DriverSafetySimulation.py :
  -The program calculates if the driver's gaze is not on the road, indicating possible distractions.
  -When this is detected, an "Attention to Road" message is displayed to remind the driver to focus on driving.
  -It also calculates the frequency of eye blinks and displays a fatigue warning if multiple blinks are detected within a short period, symbolizing fatigue or other distracting circumstances.
